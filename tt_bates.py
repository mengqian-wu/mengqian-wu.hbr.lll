# BUILD THE WORKING ENVIRONMENT

# - 1: download python 
# - 2: download sublime for writting scripts  
# - 3: get your commander ready for running scripts. 
# - 4: the interpreter and an interactive shell: https://www.python-course.eu/python3_interactive.php
# - 5: windows system(commander)/OS system(terminal.app)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M323OL6K5vs

# INSTALL MODULES 

# - play around with it, quit(), help>modules
# - what are modules? https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html    
# - modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions. We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. 

# dictionaries are like lists, except that:
#  - instead of a ORDERED sequence that you can access by it's number,
#  - the information is stored as unordered KEY-VALUE pairs
#   in the example below, the cities are the KEYS, and the populations are the VALUES

   # you define dicionaries with squiggly brackets
   # KEYS are always before a colon, and VALUES are going after a colon.

    "Mexico City": 8918653,
    "New York City": 8550405,
    "Los Angeles": 3971883,
